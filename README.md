# Projet_ENSIBS_Microprocesseur
This is a little project that i've got during my studies at ENSIBS. It's a little 8-bits processor.

The Report will explain how it works and the file .circ is the microprocessor that you can manipulate with your own instructions if you want.
To open .circ you will need "Logisim-evolution" a software done to create a lot a things in hardware.
You can find the software here : https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution
